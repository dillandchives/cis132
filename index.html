			<h2>About Me:</h2>
			<p>
				Hello and welcome! I am a part-time student at El Camino College and am currently learning basic computer science. I previously attended Elco full-time before transferring to university where I received my BA in Linguistics. I have since returned to Elco to take classes that help me explore my interests. I am still very new at computer science but am eager to learn how to make web pages. I am thrilled you stopped by!
